Dubbo is a distributed service framework enpowers applications with service import/export capability with high performance RPC.

It's composed of three kernel parts:

Remoting: a network communication framework provides sync-over-async and request-response messaging.

Clustering: a remote procedure call abstraction with load-balancing/failover/clustering capabilities.

Registry: a service directory framework for service registration and service event publish/subscription
